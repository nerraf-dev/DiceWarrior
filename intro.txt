You are standing in a strange room.
It is dark.
It is cold.

You wonder where you are.
You can't tell the size of the room.
Is it a dungeon?

You hear a growl.
Are you in a cave?

You look down. The floor...isn't stone or rock.
It's not concrete.
It has some weird lines...on....wood?

It's a gym!
A school gym!!

There is a faint glow under a few doors around the edge.
A flicker of light fills your eyes.

Then the gym returns to darkness.

There is a low hum floating through the air...

A deep voice rumbles out...

THE VOICE: 
   "Welcome Player. What should we call you?" 
You stutter...your mouth is dry...
...
...
.....

THE VOICE REPEATS: 
   "Well Player, What should we call you?"
